For this assignment I realized that it need a server.js file so I added that and filled in a bunch of requires need for npm's. I also made sure to install those npm's and add a package.json files. I added get routes but couldn't figure out how to add the post routes. I tried to deploy what I had to heroku but I got this issue in the image below and I have no idea how to remedy that.
